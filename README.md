# Insurance Data Analysis

## A project that analyzes health insurance data

This program will use Python 3 to analyze data about medical insurance costs contained in a csv file (named 'insurance.csv' in this repository). The dataset can be obtained at https://www.kaggle.com/mirichoi0218/insurance. Its content contains info on:

+ age: age of primary beneficiar
+ sex: either female or male
+ bmi: Body mass index, providing an understanding of body, weights that are relatively high or low relative to height, objective index of body weight (kg / m ^ 2) using the ratio of height to weight, ideally 18.5 to 24.9
+ children: Number of children covered by health insurance / Number of dependents
+ smoker: Smoking or not
+ region: The beneficiary's residential area in the US sorted by northeast, southeast, southwest, northwest.
+ charges: Individual medical costs billed by health insurance

The Jupyter Notebook file `us-medical-insurance-costs.ipynb` contains a walkthrough of the process and the Python code that performs the analysis.
